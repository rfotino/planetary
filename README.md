# Planetary

A browser game built with the Phaser game engine to test a "circular
platformer" game mechanic.

There is a central planet with some platforms around it, which can optionally
be moving. Enemies come from space in waves and try to destroy your planet's
cities. You can run around the planet and jump on the platforms. You must hold
off the invading enemies for as long as possible.

## Controls

* UP - jump
* LEFT - move left
* RIGHT - move right
* DOWN - drop through platforms
* SPACE - shoot
* X - switch weapons
* SHIFT - makes you not change direction when moving left and right
