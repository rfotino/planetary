# Planetary

A browser game built with the Phaser game engine to test a "circular
platformer" game mechanic.

There is a central planet with some platforms around it, which can optionally
be moving. Enemies fall from space in waves and try to kill you. You can run
around the planet and jump on the platforms. You must kill all of the enemies
before they kill you, simple enough.

A live demo of the current state of the game is up at

It is not currently mobile friendly.
